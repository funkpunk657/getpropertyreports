    <div class="faq-answer"><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Last Revised: March 29, 2015</li><br>
        <li>These Terms and Conditions of Sale (“Agreement”) govern your (“you” or “your”) purchase of Vital Amine, Inc. d/b/a Ora’s (“Ora,” “we,” ”us,” and “our”) products and services available on Ora’s website available at www.ora.organic and all content or information therein and any subdomains thereof (collectively, the “Site,” such products and services, the “Products”).  BY USING THE SITE TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR PRODUCTS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY POLICY LOCATED AT WWW.ORA.ORGANIC (“PRIVACY POLICY”) AND OUR TERMS OF SERVICE LOCATED AT WWW.ORA.ORGANIC (“TERMS OF SERVICE”).</li><br>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Applicability of Terms and Conditions.<br>Your purchase of Products from Ora is expressly made subject to this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement may be amended by Ora from time to time. You are bound by the version of this Agreement that is in effect on the date of your order of Products. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between you and Ora, and supersedes all prior communications, representations and agreements, written or oral. No additional or different terms or conditions set forth in any purchase order or other communication from you to Ora shall apply unless expressly agreed to in writing by Ora, and Ora hereby rejects any terms and conditions that are contrary to this Agreement.</li><br>
        <li>Acknowledgement.<br>You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are an individual acting in your individual capacity or as an agent of a person or entity that has authorized you to act on that person’s or entity’s behalf; (ii) you possess the legal right and ability to make a credit card charge on your own behalf or on behalf of such other person or entity; (iii) you are at least eighteen (18) years of age; and (iv) all information that you submit to Ora is true, accurate, complete and current.</li><br>
        <li>Purchase of Products.<br>If you elect to purchase Products on or through the Site,  you agree to the pricing and payment terms, as we may update them from time to time.  You may place orders for Products on the Site by following the posted directions and fully and accurately completing all information requested (including without limitation, type and quantity of Products ordered, shipping information, and payment information).  Once you place an order, the order will be transmitted to Ora for processing.  All orders are subject to acceptance by Ora, and Ora reserves the right to reject any and all orders.  The receipt of an e-mail order confirmation does not constitute the acceptance of an order or a confirmation of an offer to sell.  Ora reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item and/or refuse service to you or any customer.  Verification of information may be required prior to the acceptance of any order.  Once accepted, all orders are firm and non-cancelable by you.  Orders will be deemed accepted by Ora unless Ora notifies you of a rejection in writing (including via email) within fourteen (14) days after you place the applicable order.</li><br>
        <li>Recurring Purchases.<br>You may purchase Products on an as-needed basis or by subscribing to the monthly purchase program (the “Program”).  By subscribing to the Program, you agree that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Your subscription in the Program will be automatically extended for successive monthly periods, at the then-current subscription rate in accordance with this Section. To cancel your participation in the Program, you must log into your account and follow the applicable cancellation procedures or call us at (310) 579-9335, or email us at info@ora.organic and we will do it for you.  You must make a cancellation or change to your subscription at least five (5) business days in advance of a scheduled shipment, otherwise the scheduled purchase and applicable charges in effect prior to such cancellation/change shall apply.  Ora will process the monthly charge pertaining to the Program without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (pursuant to the above) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method.</li><br>
        <li>Prices and Taxes.<br>The prices of our Products may vary, and we may add new Products for additional fees and charges at any time in our sole discretion.  The prices for the Products shall be as set forth on the Site at the time that you place your order; however if there was an error on the posted price Ora shall inform you and the order will be cancelled or made subject to the correct pricing.  Prices are stated in U.S. dollars and include packaging and packing charges, but exclude shipping and delivery charges.  Prices shall be exclusive of all applicable customs duties and all federal, state, local, excise, sales, use and similar taxes.  All such applicable amounts, if any, shall be separately stated by Ora and shall be charged to your credit card account.</li><br>
        <li>Payment.<br>Payment for the Products may only be through valid credit cards acceptable to Ora or gift cards/codes issued by Ora (gift cards/codes cannot be redeemed for cash and are only valid for purchase of Products on the Site).  By submitting your order to Ora for processing (including providing your credit card information), you authorize Ora to charge the full amount of your order (including taxes, shipping, handling, insurance and related charges described to you on the Site) to your credit card.  You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Products and Site at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay all applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if your credit card cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your order may be suspended or cancelled automatically, with or without notice to you.  Any credit for Products that may become payable to you by Ora shall be credited to the credit card that you used to purchase the applicable Products.</li><br>
        <li>Shipping, Delivery and Risk of Loss.<br>Ora will have the Products shipped to you as they become available for shipment.  You understand that normal delivery varies substantially from Product to Product, and that delivery dates are estimates only and not guaranteed.  Ora reserves the right to ship your order in parts.  All shipping, handling, insurance and related charges will be charged to your credit card.  Title, and the risk of loss or damage while in transit, to all Products ordered by you will pass to you upon Ora’s tender of the Products to the common carrier at Ora’s facility.  You must file all claims for loss or damage directly with the carrier, and you shall remain liable to Ora for the full purchase price of the Products notwithstanding any such loss or damage.</li><br>
        <li>Products Purchased for Personal Use Only.<br>You acknowledge and agree that the prices charged to you for the Products are based upon Ora’s understanding and belief that you will use the Products for personal purposes and will not resell the Products.  You hereby expressly represent and warrant that you shall not market, resell or transfer the Products to any other party under any circumstance.</li><br>
        <li>Warranty and Returns. <br>The Products purchased by you are warranted only pursuant to the warranty information, if any, accompanying the Products.  You acknowledge and agree that Ora has no obligation to provide a refund for any Products. Although we may grant refunds, we examine refunds on a case by case basis and have the sole discretion in granting or denying any refunds.  You may return a Product only pursuant to the return procedures set forth on the Site or in the Order Summary/Return Slip accompanying the applicable Product.  All returns must be made within thirty (30) days of the date on which the applicable Product was shipped to you, and you must first contact us for a RMA number and provide all information that we request.  You must strictly comply with all instructions set forth on the Site or such Order Summary/Return Slip to receive a refund, credit or exchange, as applicable.  Your sole remedy for any defective or unwanted Product is to return the Product to Ora as set forth above.  If you return a Product without complying with the foregoing requirements, your return of the Product may be rejected by Ora or may be subject to a repackaging or restocking charge which Ora shall subtract from any refund Ora may provide to you.  Please note that you are solely responsible for paying shipping, handling and insurance on returned Products unless such Products are returned due to defect, in each case as determined by Ora in its sole discretion.  This limited warranty does not apply to any failure of a Product which in Ora’s absolute judgment is due to or as a result of: (i) your negligence, abuse, accident, improper use or other physical damage to the Product; (ii) using the Product for purposes other than as intended; (iii) combining the Product with other products not intended or recommended for use with the Product; (iv) causes beyond Ora’s control including, but not limited to, fire, flood, wind, freezing, biological infestations, unusual atmospheric conditions, or acts of war or acts of God; or (v) your violation of applicable laws or regulations regarding use of the Product.</li><br>

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties so some or all of the above exclusions may not apply to you.</li><br>
        <li>Limitation of Liability.<br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ORA, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, GOODWILL, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR LOST DATA, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING FROM YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SITE, OR ANY OF THE SITE CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SITE, EVEN IF ORA IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ORA SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR IN RELATION TO HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, OR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH ORA OR ANY OTHER USE OF THE PRODUCTS.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

              <li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the App;</li>
              <li>You acknowledge and agree that Ora, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation;</li>
              <li>You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Ora, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms;</li>

              <li>Both you and we acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the App, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</li>
              <li>Both you and we acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>
            </ul><br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The restrictions set forth in this Section 4 only apply to the extent permissible under applicable law. Nevertheless, you agree not to act contrary to them (even if permissible under applicable law) without providing 30 days' prior written notice to us, together with any information that we may reasonably require to give us an opportunity to provide alternative remedies or otherwise accommodate you at our sole discretion.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Security<br>Ora cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. You acknowledge that you provide Your Content at your own risk.  Please notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account.</li><br>
        <li>Feedback<br>If you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, or feature requests relating to the Products (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant to Ora a world-wide, royalty free, irrevocable, perpetual license to use, incorporate and otherwise exploit any Feedback in connection with the Products and any of Ora’s or any of its successors’ or affiliates’ businesses, products, technology, services, specifications or other documentation.</li><br>
        <li>Third-party links, Sites, and Services<br>Our Products may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Ora. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party websites, information, materials, products, services or content. If you access any such third party website, information, materials, products, service, or content from the Site or Products, you do so at your own risk and you agree that Ora will have no liability arising from your use of or access to any third-party website, information, materials, products, service, or content.</li><br>
        <li>Indemnity<br>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Ora, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, any related companies, suppliers, licensors and partners, and the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of each of them (collectively, the "Ora Entities") harmless from any damages, liabilities, claims or demands, including costs and legal fees, made by any third party arising out of or relating to (i) your access to or use of our Products, (ii) your violation of these Terms, (iii) any products or services purchased or obtained by you in connection with our Products, or (iv) the infringement by you, or any third party using your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. Ora reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify an Ora Entity and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of Ora. Ora will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Products.</li><br>
        <li>No Warranty<br>The Products may be unavailable from time to time for maintenance or other reasons. Ora shall have no responsibility for any interruption, delay in operation or transmission, theft or destruction of, unauthorized access to, or alteration of, any content made available via the Site. ALL USE OF THE SITE AND THE PRODUCTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE PRODUCTS AND ANY CONTENT AND INFORMATION PRESENTED ON THE SITE OR VIA THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR SAFETY. ORA MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SITE, SITE CONTENT OR PRODUCTS, OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE SITE AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, AND (II) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN. ORA DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SERVICE OR PRODUCT ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE PRODUCTS OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND ORA WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.  <br><br>
        WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER ORA NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO THE SITE, SITE CONTENT, AND PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT THE SITE, SITE CONTENT AND PRODUCTS WILL BE ERROR-FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCTS. NEITHER ORA NOR ITS LICENSORS WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE FREE FROM VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  ORA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF YOU OR ANY USER.<br><br>
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        </li><br>
        <li>Limitations of Liability<br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ORA, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, GOODWILL, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR LOST DATA, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING FROM YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SITE, OR ANY OF THE SITE CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SITE, EVEN IF ORA IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ORA SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR IN RELATION TO HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, OR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH ORA OR ANY OTHER USE OF THE PRODUCTS.<br><br>
        IN NO EVENT SHALL ORA’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE LESSER OF US $100 OR THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO ORA IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br><br>
        YOU AGREE THAT THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS IN THESE TERMS THAT LIMIT LIABILITY ARE ESSENTIAL TERMS OF THESE TERMS AND THAT ORA WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS BUT FOR THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO INDUCE ORA TO GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.<br><br>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.<br><br>
        The Products are made available from Ora’s facilities in the United States. Ora makes no representations that the Products are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Products from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Products if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found in or on the Products, including any marketing or promotional materials, are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.
        </li><br>
        <li>Arbitration<br>For any dispute you have with Ora, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. IF ORA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITH YOU INFORMALLY, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (EXCLUDING CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.  THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. §§1 ET. SEQ. (“FAA”) AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THESE TERMS OF USE. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THESE TERMS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.<br><br>
        If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Ora of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Ora should be sent by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Vital Amine, Inc. d/b/a Ora, 13802 NW Passage, Ste. 101, Marina del Rey, CA 90292. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Ora agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, CA. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Ora will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; provided that the arbitrator shall award only such damages as are permitted to be awarded pursuant to these Terms. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ORA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
        </li><br>
        <li>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<br>These Terms shall be governed by the FAA and the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, for any actions not subject to Section 11 (Arbitration), and you hereby waive all defenses for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to such courts.</li><br>
        <li>Privacy<br>You understand that by using the Products you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information and aggregate data as set forth in and in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and to have your information collected, stored, used, transferred to and processed in the United States.

        <li>General Terms<br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Assignment<br>The rights granted to you under these Terms are not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part. Any attempt to transfer these Terms without the written consent of Ora shall be void and of no force and effect. Ora may freely assign these Terms, whether to an affiliate or to another entity in connection with a corporate transaction or otherwise. These Terms will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each party’s successors and permitted assigns.</li><br>
            <li>Force Majeure<br>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</li><br>
            <li>Remedies.<br>Unless stated otherwise, all remedies provided for in these Terms shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity, or otherwise.</li><br>
            <li>Entire Agreement / Severability / Interpretation<br><br>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Terms of Sale and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Ora in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Ora concerning the Products, and there are no promises, covenants or undertakings other than those expressly set forth herein. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of these Terms but are for convenience only.</li><br>
            <li>No Waiver<br>We reserve all rights permitted to us under these Terms as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Ora's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li><br>
            <li>California Users and Residents.<br>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of information which we share with our affiliates or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates or third parties.
