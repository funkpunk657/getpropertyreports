        <ul>
          <li>Last Revised: March 29, 2015</li><br>
          <li>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Vital Amine, Inc. d/b/a Ora (“Ora,” “we,” ”us,” and “our”) collects, uses and discloses information related to our website available at www.ora.organic and all content or information therein and any subdomains thereof (collectively, the “Site”), products and services (collectively, the “Products”), and explains your choices regarding the collection, modification and use of such information.  By accessing or using our Products, you (“you”) confirm that you have read, understood and agree to in the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Products is at all times subject to the Terms of Service located at www.ora.organic/terms (“Terms”), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms.<br><br>
            We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so you should review this page periodically.  We will notify you by email or via our Products prior to the effective date of the changes.  We will also indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last made. You should revisit this Privacy Policy on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. If you do not agree with the terms of the new Privacy Policy, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to access or use the Products. Your access or use of the Products in any way after a change to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.<br><br>
            <u><b>Children’s Privacy: </b></u>The Products are not directed at children younger than 13 years of age.  You must be 18 years of age or older to use the Products. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use the Products.  If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [info@ora.organic].<br><br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><u><b>Collection and Use of Information</b></u><br>We collect the information described below regarding you and other users in connection with the Products.<br><br>
            <b>Information Provided by You or Authorized by You:</b> When you sign up for an account or use our Products, you voluntarily provide certain information about yourself. This information can include your name, profile photo, email address, location, taste and lifestyle preferences, and product category preferences; and any other information that you provide.  If you purchase products or services, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.<br>
            You also may give us permission to access your information via third party services. For example, if you register for or log into the site via Facebook, you will be asked to approve Facebook’s sharing of selected information with Ora, including basic information from your public profile (such as your name, gender, and locale), your email address, your friend list, and your Facebook.  If and when we add the ability to log in via third party services, analogous information sharing may occur.  You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Site or Products. You may also unlink your third party account from the Site or Products by adjusting your settings on the third party service.<br>
          In addition, Ora also collects and stores the content that you contribute to the Site, for example product recommendations, ratings, reviews, comments, questions, replies, “likes,” “helpful” votes, etc.<br><br>
          <b>Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Technology: </b>We may collect the following types of data via technology as you use our Products:<br><br>
          <b>Log Data:</b> When you use our Products, our servers automatically record information (“log data”) including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Ora, and cookie data.<br><br>
          <b>Cookie Data.</b> Depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Ora account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use either “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). For example, we may use cookies to store certain preferences or settings. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Ora account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us). You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can find out more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at www.allaboutcookies.org.  Note that some features of the Products may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.<br><br>
          <b>Pixel Tags:</b> We may use “pixel tags” (tiny graphic images with unique identifiers, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users). In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel tags allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce, eliminate, or modify the types of emails that users receive. <br><br>
          <b>Device Information:</b> In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device from which you’re logging into Ora, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you use and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.<br><br>
          <b>Use of Information:</b> We use or may use the information collected as described herein, including to: (a) provide, improve and monitor the effectiveness of our Products or other businesses of Ora; (b) develop new products or services; (c) protect Ora and our users; (d) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (e) provide custom, personalized content and information; (f) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (g) diagnose or fix technology problems; (h) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (i) send you updates, notifications, newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you; (j) respond to your questions or comments; and (k) process applicable payments and collect amounts that you owe Ora.<br><br></li>
          <li><u><b>Disclosure of Information</b></u><br><br>We may share your information with third parties as described in this section.<br><br>
            <b>Content:</b> When you contribute content to our Site - for example product recommendations, ratings, reviews, comments, questions, replies, “likes,” and “helpful” votes - this content will be made publicly available on the Site (where it will be accessible by both registered and unregistered users), and will potentially be made available on partner sites as well.  This content may also be featured or used in Ora or its related companies’ marketing materials.  In addition, when you populate your public profile on Ora, that information is also accessible to anyone.  You always have the option to delete a specific piece of content or terminate your account (resulting in removal of all of your content from display on the Site) at any time.<br><br>
            <b>Social Networking Sites:</b> We may share your information with third party social networking services if you have chosen to link to your Ora account to third party social networking services (e.g. Facebook), as the Products may allow you to choose to publish your activity on Ora to them.  By default we will not publish your activity on Ora to such services without your express consent.<br><br>
            <b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We may share your information with third-party business partners, consultants and service providers that perform services on our behalf for the purpose of providing the Products to you (e.g., email providers, content or product fulfillment, analytics companies, etc.). Our business partners will be given limited access to your information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Products. We may also share your information with our business partners who offer a service to you jointly with us, for example, when running a co-sponsored contest or promotion. From time to time, we may share your information with third parties who we think may offer you products or services you may enjoy.<br><br>
            <b>Links to Third-Party Sites:</b> We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Products, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Products to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our Site, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. <br><br>
            <b>Affiliates and Acquisitions:</b> We may share some or all of your information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Ora (“Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.  We may buy or sell, divest or transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as name and email address, and other user information related to the Products (as described herein) will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, liquidations or similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.<br><br>
            <b>Other disclosures:</b> We may share your information to third parties without your consent if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Ora; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<br><br>
            <b>Aggregated Information:</b> We may aggregate or anonymize information collected through the Products so that the information does not identify you. We may use or disclose aggregated, anonymized and other non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and our use and disclosure of such information is not subject to restriction.<br>
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Information Choices</b></u><br><br>
            If you have an Ora account, many of the information choices you have on Ora are built directly into the Products or your account settings. For example, you can:<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Link or unlink your Ora account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook). Eventually we plan to automate this process, but for now please contact us at info@ora.organic to do this. </li>
              <li>Limit or change information available in your public profile page at any time</li>
              <li>Delete a specific piece of content at any time</li>
              <li>Close your account at any time.  To close your account, please contact us at info@ora.organic.</li>
            </ul><br>
            You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Ora. For example:<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;</li>
              <li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.</li>
            </ul><br>
            To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.  We do not yet support the Do Not Track browser setting.<br><br>
            In addition to the above, you may update your information and email-communication preferences at any time by emailing us at info@ora.organic. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. You may not opt out of Products-related communications (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Products, technical and security notices). If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your information, you can contact us directly at info@ora.organic.<br><br>
            Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of information which we share with our affiliates or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: info@ora.organic or the postal mail address located below.<br><br>
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Retention</b></u><br><br>
            We will keep your information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that if you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your information due to technological and legal constraints.<br><br>
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Data Storage &amp; Security</b></u><br><br>
            Your information collected through the Products may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ora or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Ora may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Ora or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
            We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, Ora cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Ora or guarantee that information on the Products may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.  You acknowledge the foregoing, and that you are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your information.  For instance, you should never give out your account information for the Products to third parties.<br><br>
          </li><br>
          <li><u><b>Links to Third Party Websites and Services</b></u><br><br>
            We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Products, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Products to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our Site, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) and from other sources other than through the Products.<br><br>
